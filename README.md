# CurrencyAnalysis

Powershell script, which automatically collects currency data (such as USD, EUR) from open API (eg, PrivatBank, NBU), stores them in the CSV file, analyzes changes over a period of time and builds graphs for trend visualization. At the end of the script you can find code for sending graf by email. If you want to understand how to do it, watch it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_qCHI6syqg
